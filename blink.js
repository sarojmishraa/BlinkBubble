BluSmart, the consumer-facing fleet, operates primarily in Delhi. Gensol, by contrast, is largely a B2B solar engineering and construction player. But Gensol bought the cars and leased them to BluSmart, so the links were strong. A new owner might materialise but will have to reckon with a more fundamental question: whether the cab aggregator business model based on electric vehicles can work, even with subsidies and investors still betting on mobility and electric vehicles as a path to sustainability and climate tech.

First, he promised a boom in regional airports. Then, he revised India’s projected pilot needs to 20,000, before later increasing the estimate to 30,000 in the coming years.. Now, he’s upped the ante yet again, saying India wants to manufacture its own regional aircraft. This is a country that has long depended on foreign aircraft manufacturers. Last month, Naidu announced that a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be set up to make regional transport aircraft, a move that could place India on the global aerospace map. He said it was his dream to manufacture aircraft in India. Also Read - As Global Tariff Wars Intensify, India Must Try To Fix Its Flawed Incentives Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Naidu said the government believes India was ready to take on design, manufacturing, and maintenance of aircraft, backed by policies already in place. The SPV, which will unfold over the next five years and bring together industry stakeholders, will conduct a situational analysis and develop a roadmap for production, all under the ‘Make in India’ umbrella. According to the government, under the UDAN scheme, over 500 regional routes have been awarded to enhance air connectivity across India, though many of these routes are yet to be fully serviced. Also Read - Trump's Tariff Gambit: How India Can Navigate the New Trade Storm The government also has plans to expand airport infrastructure, adding more than 100 new airports by 2030, many of which are being developed in underserved and remote regions to support regional aviation growth. But can India really manufacture aircraft? Experts The Core spoke to believe that India should not jump in without solid data, clear demand forecasts, and real industry buy-in. “The ministry has to conduct a thorough analysis: How many aircraft are required? What kind? What’s the lead time for manufacturing? And who will manufacture — private players, HAL, or a consortium? There's also the question of maintenance, spares, and long-term support,” said Jitender Bhargava, former executive director of Air India, told The Core. Also Read - Trump Sets New World Order With Tariffs, But Will India Have An Advantage? The Reality Check India’s need for regional transport aircraft is growing rapidly, driven by a mix of government initiatives like UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik), increased connectivity to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, and the overall aviation boom. What qualifies as ‘regional’? Typically, aircraft with 30-90 seat capacity flying distances under 1,000-1,500 km, like the ATR 72, De Havilland Dash 8, or the upcoming HAL-developed aircraft like the Hindustan 228 and the 70-seater RTA-70" },

That severance helped clear everything,” he told The Core. But getting there wasn’t simple. It took him six years, multiple loans, and over Rs 2 lakh in interest on a credit card principal of just Rs 1.5 lakh, which he had slowly accumulated through missed repayments, minimum due cycles, and EMI purchases. Also Read - Reinventing Again And Again: Mercedes-Benz India CEO Santosh Iyer On Catching Up With EV Boom And India Strategy At its peak, Arun had Rs 1.5 lakh in credit card debt, and another Rs 3.4 lakh in personal and EMI loans.

A close friend of his, also in his mid-30s and living in Pune with a family, is currently juggling Rs 5 lakh in credit card dues and non-mortgage loans exceeding Rs 35 lakh. His monthly EMI? Over Rs 2 lakh—the same as his monthly income. Also Read - Why Celebrating Lower Tariffs Misses The Bigger Battle Their stories are far from rare. After a strong end to 2024, credit card spending in India fell sharply in February 2025. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), total credit card spending stood at Rs 1.67 lakh crore in February 2025, down from Rs 1.84 lakh crore in January 2025. Transaction volumes also dropped to 39.6 crore in February, compared to 43 crore the previous month. However, spending remained higher on a year-on-year basis, up from Rs 1.49 lakh crore in February 2024, suggesting continued momentum in overall credit usage. Also Read - Edelweiss Chairman Rashesh Shah On What’s Holding Back India’s Credit Market Evolution Still, the sequential decline is notable. “There is always a seasonal adjustment that happens after the year-end and new year spending. A lot of consumers, especially in urban segments, frontload discretionary spending between September and January,” Arvind Datta, founder of Marigold Wealth and a former banker in credit risk, told The Core. Even so, the depth of the pullback — nearly Rs 17,000 crore in value and over 3 crore fewer transactions — points to a more cautious consumer base in early 2025. Also Read - Could Upskilling Be The Answer To India’s Wage Gap Problem? Non-performing assets (NPAs) — or the amount defaulted by customers — in the credit card segment rose by 28.42% over the last year, reaching Rs 6,742 crore during the 12-month period ending December 2024, according to the latest data from the RBI. That’s an increase of nearly Rs 1,500 crore from Rs 5,250 crore in December 2023, and the highest level recorded in absolute terms in India’s credit card market. For comparison, gross NPAs stood at: Rs 2,404 crore in March 2020, just before the onset of the pandemic Around Rs 1,100 crore in December 2019 Over Rs 5,000 crore in write-offs during the 2008 financial crisis, which had prompted banks to slash their card portfolios and tighten underwriting Despite the sharp rise in value terms, the NPA ratio remains within the expected range, at around 2.3% of total outstanding dues, which touched Rs 2.9 lakh crore as of December 2024. For card issuers, this is still manageable — many operate profitably with net credit losses in the 4–6% range due to high revolving interest rates and fee income. However, headline ratios can obscure the true picture of borrower-level vulnerabilities. As reported by The Core in 2023, rising defaults in categories such as buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), instant credit, payday loans and digital EMI cards had already begun surfacing, prompting the Reserve Bank of India to step in. In November that year, the RBI increased risk weights by 25 percentage points on unsecured lending, including credit card receivables and bank exposures to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). A closer look shows that the economic risk isn’t just in rising defaults, but in who is borrowing, how easily that credit is accessed, and what happens when repayment capacity slips. New-to-credit (NTC) consumers are often juggling multiple forms of unsecured debt — from credit cards to BNPL to personal loans — without fully understanding the compounding consequences. While credit card debt may appear under control on paper, the underlying stress is quietly building across borrower segments, bank portfolios, and fintech channels alike" },

Neuroscience and AI are converging in fascinating ways—AI systems are now capable of simulating neural activity, processing sensory data, and even mimicking decision-making processes that mirror human cognition. Researchers are using machine learning to decode brain scans, model neurological diseases, and explore how memory, perception, and emotions arise from neural networks. Projects like the Human Brain Project in Europe and the U.S. BRAIN Initiative are pushing boundaries, aiming to digitally map the brain and replicate its processes. Meanwhile, developments in neural networks and deep learning owe much to insights from biological systems. Philosophically, these advances challenge our definitions of consciousness—if machines can replicate aspects of awareness, what does it mean to be 'conscious'? While AI doesn’t yet possess subjective experience, its role in unraveling the mysteries of the mind is expanding rapidly, heralding a new era of brain-inspired computing and scientific discovery."

          description: "The creator economy has emerged as a powerful force reshaping modern entrepreneurship, where individuals monetize their content, skills, and influence directly through digital platforms. Powered by YouTube, Instagram, Substack, TikTok, and emerging blockchain-based networks, this decentralized economic model allows creators—from writers and gamers to fitness coaches and educators—to reach global audiences without traditional intermediaries. Unlike past eras, today’s creators can earn through subscriptions, digital goods, NFTs, crowdfunding, and branded partnerships, building personal brands and businesses with autonomy. Platforms have responded by offering revenue-sharing models, creator funds, and tools for analytics and community building. The rise of Web3 and decentralized finance (DeFi) introduces further disruption, enabling creators to own their content and income streams via smart contracts and tokens. However, sustainability remains a challenge—platform dependency, algorithm changes, and burnout pose real risks. Governments are also beginning to recognize this economy through taxation and labor laws. As the line between work and identity blurs, the creator economy is setting new standards for how people work, connect, and build digital livelihoods."

India accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, allegedly carried out by the militant group Kashmir Resistance. In response, India revoked all Pakistani visas, expelled diplomats, suspended trade, closed the only land border crossing, and halted the crucial Indus Water Treaty. Pakistan retaliated by closing its airspace to Indian flights and severing trade ties. The incident has intensified domestic pressure on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, with calls for military action gaining momentum. Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Modi have hinted at potential military responses. Pakistan, while denying involvement, warned that any Indian aggression would be met with a matching response across its full spectrum of power. This latest crisis follows Modi's controversial 2019 move to revoke Kashmir's semi-autonomous status. While a 2021 ceasefire had held tensions at bay, the current escalation raises fears of a broader conflict. In Kashmir, the rare civilian-targeted attack has sparked local protests and heightened anxiety about impacts on tourism and regional stability. Analysts warn of limited options left if both sides continue escalating without addressing the underlying political unrest in the region."

Founded in 2003, and largely shaped by the vision and leadership of Elon Musk, Tesla has revolutionized the automotive and clean energy sectors through the application of advanced scientific research and engineering principles. At the heart of Tesla’s technological prowess lies its mastery of lithium-ion battery technology, which has been foundational to its electric vehicles and energy products. Tesla vehicles, such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and the upcoming Cybertruck and Roadster, are powered by meticulously designed battery packs that utilize thousands of individual lithium-ion cells organized into modules. These batteries offer industry-leading energy density, range, and performance, with Tesla’s engineering teams continually optimizing for longevity, thermal efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Tesla’s introduction of the 4680 battery cell marked a significant leap forward in battery innovation, offering greater energy output, faster charging, and a more efficient structural design that contributes to the vehicle’s overall integrity and weight distribution. Supporting this battery evolution are Tesla’s Gigafactories—massive production facilities located in Nevada, Texas, Berlin, and Shanghai—designed to vertically integrate the manufacturing process, increase output, reduce costs, and enable scalability. These facilities harness automation, robotics, and machine learning algorithms to streamline operations and ensure consistent quality, positioning Tesla as a leader in sustainable mass production. Beyond batteries, Tesla’s commitment to technological innovation is most evident in its autonomous driving capabilities. Tesla's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems represent some of the most advanced implementations of computer vision, deep learning, and neural network-based AI in the automotive world. Using an array of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, radar (in earlier versions), and an in-house supercomputer known as Dojo, Tesla vehicles process real-time data to interpret traffic patterns, lane markings, pedestrians, and obstacles, enabling semi-autonomous and eventually fully autonomous driving. The company’s vision-based approach to autonomy—eschewing LIDAR in favor of neural net perception—relies on billions of miles of real-world data collected from its fleet of vehicles, enabling its AI models to train in edge cases and improve continuously via over-the-air updates. Tesla’s Dojo supercomputer is particularly noteworthy, engineered to train massive neural networks at unprecedented speed using custom-designed chips and architecture, placing Tesla at the cutting edge of AI hardware as well as software.

These solar solutions are complemented by the Tesla Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack—advanced lithium-ion battery storage systems that store excess solar energy for later use, enhancing energy independence and resilience. Megapacks, in particular, are designed for grid-scale deployment and are already being used in several large-scale energy projects around the world to stabilize grids and support renewable energy integration. Tesla’s energy management systems use advanced software to optimize energy usage, forecast demand, and interact with the grid in real time, ensuring efficient and sustainable energy consumption. Moreover, Tesla has created an entire ecosystem around its products, integrating software, hardware, and cloud-based platforms to deliver seamless user experiences. From the Tesla mobile app, which allows remote control and monitoring of vehicles and energy products, to the infotainment systems powered by Tesla's custom OS and high-performance chips, every product reflects a synergy between form and function, underpinned by robust scientific and engineering foundations. Tesla’s innovation does not stop at current products; the company continues to invest heavily in research and development to tackle future challenges. This includes work on alternative battery chemistries, such as lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and solid-state batteries, which promise further gains in safety, cost, and energy density. In transportation, Tesla is also working on the Tesla Semi, an all-electric class 8 truck that aims to revolutionize freight logistics with zero-emission hauling, and the futuristic Cybertruck, designed with ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel and armored glass, pushing the boundaries of vehicle design and material science. Furthermore, Tesla’s approach to manufacturing is itself a technological breakthrough. The use of giant casting machines called Giga Presses allows Tesla to create single-piece castings for vehicle underbodies, significantly reducing complexity, weight, and assembly time. This innovative production method, paired with its AI-driven supply chain and logistics management, gives Tesla a unique edge in terms of manufacturing efficiency and scalability. The synergy between software and hardware is another hallmark of Tesla’s technological ecosystem. With over-the-air software updates, Tesla vehicles improve over time, gaining new features, enhancements, and security patches remotely. This software-centric approach not only differentiates Tesla from traditional automakers but also aligns it more closely with tech companies like Apple and Google. Tesla vehicles run on proprietary software platforms that manage everything from battery performance and climate control to autopilot navigation and entertainment, offering users a truly integrated and upgradable experience. The science behind Tesla's success also lies in its culture of relentless experimentation, data-driven development, and first-principles thinking. Elon Musk often emphasizes breaking down problems to their fundamental truths and reasoning from there—a method that permeates Tesla’s engineering philosophy. Whether it’s reimagining the automotive supply chain, building custom silicon for AI training, or rethinking vehicle design from the ground up, Tesla approaches problems with an openness to reinvent traditional paradigms. Environmental sustainability is another core pillar of Tesla’s mission, and science plays a crucial role in evaluating and minimizing environmental impact. Tesla’s lifecycle assessments of battery production, vehicle emissions, and recycling processes help inform more sustainable choices at every stage of production. Tesla is also investing in battery recycling through initiatives like Redwood Materials and internal R&D to create closed-loop systems that reduce waste and reclaim valuable materials. The science of materials engineering plays a crucial role in Tesla’s product development. From the heat-resistant alloys used in battery casings to the innovative polymers in the interiors, Tesla engineers carefully select materials that are lightweight, durable, and sustainable. For example, Tesla’s Cybertruck introduces ultra-hard stainless steel in its exoskeleton, a decision driven by both aesthetics and function, creating a vehicle that is nearly impenetrable while also cutting manufacturing steps by removing the need for paint. Additionally, Tesla’s aerodynamic designs, including hidden door handles, low drag coefficients, and smart air suspension, are all engineered through computational fluid dynamics and rigorous wind tunnel testing to enhance range and performance. Another domain where Tesla applies science extensively is thermodynamics, particularly in battery and vehicle thermal management systems. Efficient cooling and heating of battery packs is critical to ensure optimal performance and longevity, especially in extreme climates. Tesla uses a combination of heat pumps, liquid cooling loops, and software-based thermal management algorithms to dynamically adjust system temperatures. The introduction of the heat pump system in the Model Y, for instance, brought a significant improvement in cold-weather range efficiency, demonstrating Tesla’s continual refinement of vehicle subsystems. Tesla also contributes to scientific research by sharing data, partnering with academic institutions, and publishing white papers on battery advancements and sustainability practices. This transparency helps foster a broader ecosystem of innovation and positions Tesla as not just a manufacturer, but a science-driven organization influencing global discourse on technology and sustainability. The scientific research driving Tesla’s autopilot and full self-driving system is particularly intense. Tesla employs thousands of AI engineers and data scientists working on vision processing, behavior prediction, path planning, and control systems. Tesla’s approach to autonomy is end-to-end learning, where raw video data is processed directly into actionable driving decisions by neural networks, much like how human drivers rely on visual cues. This methodology, while controversial, has shown promising results and continues to improve rapidly, thanks to fleet learning, where data from millions of miles driven by Tesla cars is fed back into the training pipeline. This feedback loop, combined with Dojo’s processing power, helps Tesla iterate on its driving models faster than most competitors. Finally, Tesla’s role in shaping the future extends beyond its products. The company is actively influencing policy, infrastructure, and consumer behavior. Tesla Superchargers form a vast global network of high-speed EV charging stations, many powered by solar energy, making long-distance EV travel practical. Tesla’s open-source philosophy—such as its early decision to open its patents—has spurred innovation across the EV industry, encouraging competition and collaboration. Through its work, Tesla is helping to catalyze a global transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable, electrified future. In conclusion, Tesla is not just a car company—it is a high-tech powerhouse leveraging a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines to solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges. From battery chemistry and AI to robotics and renewable energy, Tesla’s innovations are rooted in deep scientific understanding and a commitment to progress. Its ability to integrate multiple fields of science and engineering into cohesive, scalable solutions makes it a model for 21st-century innovation.
